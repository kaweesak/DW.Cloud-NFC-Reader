  LCD5110_SPIflash.h - Add-on library to integrate LCD5110_Graph and SPIflash
  Copyright (C)2015 Rinky-Dink Electronics, Henning Karlsen. All right reserved
  
  This library is an add-on to LCD5110_Graph and will not work on its own. This 
  add-on library also requires the SPIflash library.
  Note that this library does not work in combination with the LCD5110_Basic library.

  This library adds a simple way to load images from SPI flash chip. The images 
  must be contained within the SPIflash file system. Images can be added to the 
  flash chips using the FlashUploader tool supplied with the SPIflash library.
